ALG-1015 - Develop SJF-NoExpulsivo algorithm:

  ✔ The algorithm has to get the difference among the px(execution-time) & py+1(wait time) wheter px is greater that py+1 and save it into an array. @done (16-11-14 23:16)
  ☐ The algorithm has to do an operation to show in the dynamic container the wait and ocuppation time of each process  
  ☐ Calculate average of all the process and print it out on the dynamic container.

Estimation: 
  5 points.
